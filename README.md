# Mechanical Vibration Analyzer
Hey! This is a mechanical vibration system solver that takes inputs for damping, mass, spring constants, and initial conditions to produce a graphical analysis of the spring system's displacement and velocity through the analysis of differential equations. It first identifies the type of vibration system given, then solves and graphs the functions of displacement and time of the oscillating mass.
