# Mechanical Vibration Analyzer
Hey! This is a mechanical vibration system solver that takes inputs for damping, mass, spring constants, forcing functions, and initial conditions to produce a graphical analysis of the spring system's displacement, velocity, and total energy through the analysis of differential equations. It first identifies the type of vibration system given, then solves and graphs the functions of displacement, velocity, and energy over time. It additionally takes the fourier transform of the displacement function to analyze the magnitude of the frequencies that surface in the functions.
